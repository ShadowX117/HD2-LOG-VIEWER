![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ERRORX2/HD2-LOG-VIEWER?color=blue&label=Latest%20Version)

**HD2 LOG VIEWER** is a professional-grade telemetry utility designed for high-frequency hardware log analysis. Optimized for stability testing, thermal diagnostics, and hardware troubleshooting, it provides an interactive interface for visualizing and diagnosing data from **HWiNFO64**, **GPU-Z**, and **MSI Afterburner**.

## 🛡️ Security & Transparency

Because this utility is packaged using PyInstaller, some antivirus engines may flag the executable as a false positive.

Previously, automated VirusTotal scanning was integrated into the CI pipeline. This has been removed for the following technical and operational reasons:

- **Binary size constraints:** The compiled executable is large due to bundled dependencies, which makes repeated API uploads inefficient and prone to request failures or rate limiting.
- **API cost / quota limitations:** Continuous scanning of every build consumes VirusTotal API quota. For a free and frequently built project, this introduces unnecessary operational cost.
- **CI overhead:** Uploading and polling external scan results significantly increases build time without affecting runtime functionality or binary correctness.

### 🔍 Current security model

- Each release includes a **SHA256 checksum** for integrity verification of the distributed archive.
- The project is built deterministically via **GitHub Actions**, with artifacts generated directly from source.
- Manual VirusTotal scans may still be performed selectively on major releases when required.

This approach prioritizes build stability, reproducibility, and cost efficiency while maintaining basic integrity validation.

## 🛠️ Core Features

### 📊 Visualization
* **Multi-Plot Mode:** Split sensors into categorized subplots — temperatures, clocks, voltages, utilization — for side-by-side comparison without overlap.
* **Heatmap Mode:** Color-coded stress visualization across all selected sensors simultaneously, using absolute thresholds for known sensor types and per-sensor normalization as fallback.
* **Δ Delta Mode:** Graph the absolute difference between sensor values over time — useful for tracking GPU core vs. hotspot spread or VRM thermal delta.
* **Time Mode:** Switch the X-axis between raw polling ticks and actual elapsed time when a timestamp column is detected.
* **Interactive Tooltip:** Hover over any point on the chart for a synchronized readout of all plotted sensors at that exact moment.
* **Signal Event Timeline:** A dedicated timeline strip below the chart marks where hardware anomalies were detected. Click any marker to jump directly to that moment and see what triggered it.
* **Chart Export:** Save the current view as a high-resolution PNG (300 DPI) including the full sensor legend, or copy it directly to the clipboard with `Ctrl+C`.

### 🔍 Sensor Management
* **Categorized Sensor List:** Sensors are automatically sorted into groups — Temperatures, Utilization, Clocks, Power, Voltage, Fan Speeds — for fast navigation across large logs.
* **Live Search:** Filter the sensor list in real time by typing; results update instantly.
* **Out-of-Spec Filter:** One click hides all normal sensors and shows only those currently reading outside safe thresholds, highlighted in the list.
* **Sensor Alias System:** Permanently rename ambiguous or hardware-specific sensor columns so they are correctly identified across any future log file from the same machine.
* **Preset Groups:** Save any combination of selected sensors as a named preset. Apply, rename, delete, or share presets via clipboard — paste a shared preset from another user directly into the app.

### 🔬 Diagnostics
* **Hardware Failure Diagnosis:** Runs a full signature scan and presents findings as severity-tagged cards (Critical / Warning / Info) with plain-English descriptions, evidence values, and one-click sensor selection to jump straight to the relevant chart.
* **Session Summary Narrative:** Automatically generates a plain-English paragraph summarizing the most significant findings and any causal relationships between issues detected.
* **Discord Summary Copy:** Copies a compact, formatted summary of the session narrative and all detected signals — including severity and evidence — ready to paste directly into Discord or a support ticket.
* **Real-Time Signature Badges:** The sidebar shows a live count of critical, warning, and info signals as soon as the scan completes in the background, without opening the diagnosis window.
* **Out-of-Spec Detection:** Independently flags individual sensors that exceed configured thresholds, separate from the full signature engine.
* **Detected Hardware View:** Parses the CSV label rows to identify and display the actual hardware devices present in the log — CPU, GPU, storage drives, network adapters, and more — grouped by category.

### 🔁 Session Comparison
* **Reference Baseline:** Pin the current session as a reference, then load a second CSV to compare directly against it.
* **Overlay Mode:** Draws both sessions on the same axes so differences in thermals, clocks, or power are immediately visible.
* **Delta Summary Panel:** Shows avg/max/min differences between the current and reference session for every selected sensor, displayed as an annotated panel on the chart.
* **Swap Reference:** Swap the current and reference sessions without reloading either file.

### 📄 Reporting
* **HTML Report Export:** Generates a fully self-contained HTML report including detected hardware, session summary, all signature findings, out-of-spec sensors, per-sensor charts (selected and by category), PSU rail voltages, and a full statistics table. No internet connection required to view.

### 🎨 Theming
* **14 Built-in Themes:** Dark (Default), Light (Default), Slate, Teal, Forest Green, Crimson, Steel, Lime, Violet, Lavender, Cobalt, Neon Blue, Sand, Monochrome, and the Helldivers 2 theme.
* **Theme Editor:** Customize any theme's background, surface, border, text, accent, plot line colors, and heatmap band colors using a color picker. Save as a named user theme.
* **Import / Export Themes:** Share themes as `.json` files. Import a theme file and it is immediately available in the editor.
* **Persistent Theme:** The active theme and all customizations are saved and restored between sessions.

### ⚙️ Settings & Configuration
* **Limits Editor:** Configure every detection threshold — temperature limits per component type, voltage rail safe ranges, power maximums, fan stall thresholds, frametime limits, and all signature-specific sensitivity parameters.
* **Signature Controls:** Enable or disable individual signatures from the settings panel. The signal timeline and badge counts update accordingly.
* **Tooltip Toggle:** Enable or disable the hover tooltip from the top bar without restarting.
* **Crash Recovery:** Automatically trims corrupted or zeroed rows commonly left at the end of logs after crashes or hard resets.
* **Update Notifications:** Checks for new releases silently on startup. If an update is found, you can open the release page, ignore that specific version, or disable future notifications. A manual check is available via the ⟳ button at any time.
* **Debug Dump:** A hidden developer panel (`Ctrl+F8`) shows all resolved sensor columns, detected values, fabric clock ratios, PSU rail analysis, and internal state — useful for diagnosing why a signature did or did not fire.
